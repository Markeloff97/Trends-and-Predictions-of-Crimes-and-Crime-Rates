# Trends-and-Predictions-of-Crimes-and-Crime-Rates
Background: Predictive policing refers to the use of law enforcement by statistical, predictive 
modeling, and other scientific approaches to detect suspected illegal behavior. It has been 
proven an effective technique to reduce the crimes from happening in the future to some 
extent.
Aims: To find if there are any patterns to crimes happening over different months and 
subsequently getting to know the factors contributing towards increase or decrease in crimes. 
Also comparing crimes of two counties (Derbyshire and South Yorkshire) from UK based on five 
different crimes (Burglary, Criminal damage and arson, Other theft, Violence and sexual 
offences, Vehicle crime) happened over the period of 3 years (2017-2020).
Methods: Publicly available UK Police data from 2017-2020 was used as a basis for this report.
The crime data was retrieved for the counties of Derbyshire and South Yorkshire from the used 
Police Datasets. A combination of Line graph and Choropleth Maps were used to acquire the 
required result.
